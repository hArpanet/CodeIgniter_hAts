----------

NOTE:
You can put part files (.phtml) directly into this 'parts' root folder.
Any files located here will be the 'fallback' (or default) files that hATS
will use if it can't find a particular part file in a sub-folder.

This means that sub-folder parts over-ride these default parts placed here.
